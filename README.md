# üõí Agentic AI Retail Churn Prediction Pipeline

## Overview

This project implements an **Agentic AI pipeline** for retail churn prediction using CrewAI, Large Language Models (LLMs), and modular agents. It simulates a real-world, enterprise-grade scenario where multiple intelligent agents automate data aggregation, churn risk scoring, customer segmentation, offer optimization, and feedback analysis‚Äîdelivering actionable business outcomes with minimal manual intervention.

## Problem Statement

**Retailers face high customer churn rates, impacting revenue and growth.**  
Predicting which customers are likely to churn, understanding their profiles, and proactively engaging them with personalized retention strategies is critical. Traditional approaches are manual, slow, and fail to deliver targeted action.

## What This Project Does

1. **Aggregates customer data** from various sources.
2. **Scores each customer for churn risk** using ML/AI models.
3. **Segments customers into actionable personas** (e.g., high-risk, moderate, low-risk).
4. **Assigns optimal retention offers** to at-risk segments.
5. **Engages customers** with personalized messaging.
6. **Collects and analyzes feedback** to improve future outreach.

The entire pipeline operates autonomously, with agents passing results and insights to each other‚Äîmimicking a real ‚Äúdigital workforce‚Äù.

# AI-Powered Customer Churn Prediction & Retention Pipeline

## Overview
This project is an AI-powered, modular pipeline designed to help retail clients predict customer churn, segment customers into actionable personas, optimize retention offers, engage customers, and use feedback for continuous improvement.

The architecture leverages **Agentic AI** concepts: multiple specialized agents perform focused tasks and collaborate asynchronously within a defined workflow.

## High-Level Workflow
1. **Data Aggregation** - Collect and unify customer data from multiple sources.
2. **Churn Prediction** - Predict customer churn risk using ML models.
3. **Persona Building** - Segment customers into distinct personas.
4. **Offer Optimization** - Recommend retention offers based on risk and persona.
5. **Customer Engagement** - Generate personalized messages and select optimal channels.
6. **Feedback Loop** - Collect and process feedback to refine future actions.

Each step is handled by a dedicated agent class, orchestrated through CrewAI's task pipeline.
